# Hi there, I'm Leonardo Barone! üëã

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
I'm graduated in Mathematical Engineering with a specialization in Statistical Learning.

### Master Thesis:
- **[PAK-MAN: Optimal Cloud and HPC Systems Parallel Optimization via Bayesian Optimization and Machine Learning](https://github.com/baroneleonardo/PAKMAN)**  
  Developed and evaluated an algorithm integrating parallel Bayesian optimization and machine learning models. This project focuses on constrained optimization problems within HPC and cloud systems.

### Other Projects
- **[Informed Proposal Sampling Strategy](https://github.com/baroneleonardo/Informed-proposal-sampling-strategy)**
  Bayesian nonparametric change points detection for multivariate time series with missing observations implemented in R.
- **[NO2-Virtual-Sensor](https://github.com/baroneleonardo/NO2-Virtual-Sensor)**
  We apply three popular machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Neural Network. Through comprehensive experimentation and evaluation, we compare the performance of these machine learning models in accurately predicting NO2 concentrations.
